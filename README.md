# NaughtsNCrosses_V2
I can't get my commits from NaughtsNCrosses to push. This is the only way I can find to fix this, I know it isn't the best but it's the only way I can find.

I had an issue where I was unabe to push a commit due to it's large file size.
I looked for a solutoion but never found fetures like 'undo most recent commit' so was unable to find any way to upload the commit.
This was the only way I could find to upload the new version.
